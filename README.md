# La Détection D’intrusion Intelligent Dans Le Réseau SDN En Se Basant Sur Le Deep Learning (GAN Autoencoder)

## Overview

This project focuses on the intelligent detection of intrusions in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments using Deep Learning techniques, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Autoencoders. The aim is to enhance network security by accurately identifying malicious activities in real-time.

## Background

Software-Defined Networking is a revolutionary approach that allows for more agile and efficient network management. However, its centralized nature poses significant security challenges. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques for intrusion detection.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
2. Create a virtual environment:
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of network traffic data. It includes both normal and attack traffic, enabling the model to learn the characteristics of each.
